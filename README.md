this is my license plate tracker. 
i spend an inordinate amount of time at bus stops, as a fully licensed, but inactive driver. (my behind needs a car)
i often like to stare at cars going by. This way with my tracker it feels like playing pokemon. 
im constantly on the look out for the next out of state plate. 
i started this in ontario when on academic exchange at queen's university, but home is california.
hence why i have (outside) listed on the california and ontario plates, as id literally not be able to function in society if 
i was trying to mark all of the cars with CA plates or ON plates when in those places haha. 


Start date for collecting was: 10/28/2024


Finished US November 2025. Saw a west virgina plate which eluded me for 8 months on a van which looked like it was being driven by a 12 year old.
