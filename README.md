this is my license plate tracker. 
i spend an inordinate amount of time at bus stops, as a fully licensed, but inactive driver.
i often like to stare at cars going by. This way with my tracker it feels like playing pokemon. 
im constantly on the look out for the next out of state plate. 
i started this in ontario when on academic exchange at queen's university, but home is california.
hence why i have (outside) listed on the california and ontario plates, as id literally not be able to function in society if 
i was trying to mark all of the cars with CA plates or ON plates when in those places haha. 

idk how you found this, and why you're reading this, but if you are feel free to clone it if you like. I just ask that you dont 
try using the existing page since im a lazy coder n dont wanna add different users or whatever. thanks
